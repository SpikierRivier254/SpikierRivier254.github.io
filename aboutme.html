One of my favorites hobbies is videogame, since I was 5 years old I've been playing videogame and I grown with this. This was my main motivation to get into the tech world and coding. I try to work hard to get into my objrctives, to make the world a better eplace to live, I know it sounds genmeric but I'll do eveything I can to make it become true.</p><br><br>

            <p>One of my favorites things to do is play videogames, since I was a kid I've been palying videogames my whole life, I spent hours into those fictional universes provided by the videogames. I try to get into eveything related to this an stay tuned on this world, it was very important to my life, with the videogames I started to learn about the world of the informatic and it gave me the inspiration to study programing and learn more about the computer programing world. Movies is something i love to watch and I spend hours watching and thinking about the films I watch, One of my favorite movie category is romance, comedy, science-fiction and superheroes movies. Another passion I have I got it recently thanks to a friend, Anime is amazing, i watch it an I feel the emotions and the feeling of what is being lived by the characters and I love to see the art and the stoty development. A weird thing I like to do is study, I love to study things wich I am interested in, It relaxes and makes me feel fine, it helps me a lot and is very rewardful.</p><br><br>
